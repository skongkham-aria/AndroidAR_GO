# üî¥ CRITICAL: .aar File Not Being Included in APK

## The Problem

Your logs show:
```
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: no non-static method 'initializeDetector' 
in class java.lang.Object;
```

**This means:** The `FastNativeDetect-debug.aar` file is **NOT being included** in your APK build.

---

## ‚úÖ What I Just Fixed

### 1. Updated `.aar.meta` File Configuration
**File:** `Assets/Plugins/Android/FastNativeDetect-debug.aar.meta`

Added proper Android platform configuration:
```yaml
platformData:
  - Android: enabled: 1, CPU: ARMv7
  - Android: enabled: 1, CPU: ARM64
```

### 2. Enhanced Diagnostic Logging
**File:** `Assets/Scripts/AR/AndroidNativeDetector.cs`

Added detailed step-by-step logging to show:
- Native library class type verification
- Exact error messages when loading fails
- Clear troubleshooting instructions

---

## üö® REQUIRED STEPS (Follow Exactly)

### Step 1: Close Unity Completely
**Why:** Unity caches plugin configurations in the Library folder

### Step 2: Delete Cache Folders

Open PowerShell in your project folder and run:

```powershell
cd "d:\My Project\AndroidAR"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force Library
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force Temp
```

Or manually delete these folders:
- `d:\My Project\AndroidAR\Library\`
- `d:\My Project\AndroidAR\Temp\`

### Step 3: Reopen Unity

1. Launch Unity
2. **Wait** for it to re-import all assets (watch the progress bar)
3. Check Console for any import errors

### Step 4: Verify .aar Configuration in Unity

1. Navigate to: `Assets ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Android`
2. Click on: `FastNativeDetect-debug.aar`
3. **Check the Inspector panel** (right side):

You MUST see:
```
‚úì Select platforms for plugin
   ‚úì Android (CHECKED)
   ‚òê Editor
   ‚òê Standalone
   etc.

‚úì Platform settings
   Android
   ‚úì CPU: ARMv7
   ‚úì CPU: ARM64
```

**If you don't see "Android" checked**, the .meta file didn't update correctly.

### Step 5: Force Reimport (If Needed)

If the Inspector doesn't show the correct settings:

1. Right-click `FastNativeDetect-debug.aar`
2. Select **"Reimport"**
3. Check Inspector again

### Step 6: Clean Build

```
File ‚Üí Build Settings ‚Üí Build and Run
```

**Important:**
- ‚úÖ Check "Development Build" (for better logs)
- ‚úÖ Make sure Android platform is selected

## üì± Expected New Logs

After rebuilding with the fixes, you'll see detailed diagnostics:

## üîç How to Verify .aar is in APK (Advanced)

### Method 1: Check Build Log

After building, check `Editor.log`:

**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\..\Local\Unity\Editor\Editor.log`

Search for:
```
Including plugin: Assets/Plugins/Android/FastNativeDetect-debug.aar
```

If you **DON'T** see this line, the .aar is not being included!

### Method 2: Inspect APK Contents

```powershell
# Extract APK (it's a ZIP file)
cd "d:\My Project\AndroidAR\Builds"
Expand-Archive -Path "YourApp.apk" -DestinationPath "apk_contents" -Force

# Check for .aar classes
# Look for: apk_contents/classes.dex or lib/armeabi-v7a/
```

You should find compiled classes from the .aar in the APK.

---

## üÜò If Still Not Working

### Check 1: .aar File Integrity

Verify the .aar contains your NativeLib class:

```powershell
cd "d:\My Project\AndroidAR\Assets\Plugins\Android"
Expand-Archive -Path "FastNativeDetect-debug.aar" -DestinationPath "aar_check" -Force

# Check for classes.jar
Get-ChildItem "aar_check"
```

You should see:
- `classes.jar` (contains your Java classes)
- `AndroidManifest.xml`
- possibly `jni/` folder (native libraries)

### Check 2: Package Name Mismatch

Extract `classes.jar` and verify package structure:

```powershell
cd "d:\My Project\AndroidAR\Assets\Plugins\Android\aar_check"
Expand-Archive -Path "classes.jar" -DestinationPath "classes" -Force

# Look for NativeLib.class
Get-ChildItem -Recurse "classes" | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "NativeLib.class"}
```

The path should be: `classes/com/example/fastnativedetect/NativeLib.class`

**If the path is different**, you need to update the package name in `AndroidNativeDetector.cs` line 38:

```csharp
nativeLib = new AndroidJavaObject("YOUR.ACTUAL.PACKAGE.NativeLib");
```

### Check 3: Unity Build Settings

1. `File ‚Üí Build Settings`
2. Select Android platform
3. Click `Player Settings`
4. Under `Other Settings`:
   - Minimum API Level: Should be 24 or higher
   - Target API Level: Should be 30 or higher
   - Scripting Backend: IL2CPP (recommended) or Mono

## üìã Quick Checklist

Before reporting back, verify:

- [ ] Closed Unity completely
- [ ] Deleted `Library/` folder
- [ ] Deleted `Temp/` folder  
- [ ] Reopened Unity
- [ ] Waited for asset reimport to complete
- [ ] Checked `.aar` in Inspector shows "Android" CHECKED
- [ ] Built a fresh APK
- [ ] Deployed to device
- [ ] Collected new logs with enhanced diagnostics

---

## üí° Most Common Causes

**90% of the time, this is caused by:**

1. Unity caching old plugin configuration (Library folder)
2. .meta file not properly configured
3. Not reimporting after meta file changes

**The solution:** Clean Library, verify .meta, rebuild.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Follow the steps above exactly**
2. **Rebuild and deploy**
3. **Share the NEW logs** - they will be much more detailed now
4. The enhanced logging will tell us exactly what's failing

The new diagnostics will show the exact class name being loaded, so we can see if it's `java.lang.Object` (failure) or `com.example.fastnativedetect.NativeLib` (success).
